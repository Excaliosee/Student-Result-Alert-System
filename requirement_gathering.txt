STUDENT RESULT ALERT SYSTEM

​1) Gathering Required Information

​The Student Result Alert System is an automated notification platform designed to bridge the communication gap between educational institutions, students, and parents. Unlike a static database, this system actively monitors the "Result" table and triggers real-time alerts (via Email or SMS) as soon as marks are published. The primary objective is to ensure transparency, provide instant feedback on academic performance, and eliminate the need for students to manually check portals repeatedly.


​Stakeholders


​ - Administrator: Uploads bulk results, manages the notification gateway (API settings), and monitors delivery logs.
​ - Faculty: Inputs subject-wise marks and validates results before the alert trigger is activated.
​ - Students/Parents: Receive automated notifications and view detailed electronic report cards.
​
